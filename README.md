# audit.me
**audit.me** is a project designed to automate the smart contract auditing process. By leveraging a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline in LangChain, the platform enhances the reliability and security of Solidity smart contracts. Using LLM-driven analysis, the platform retrieves relevant information from a vector database of known vulnerabilities and identifies issues in the user's submitted code. Potential fixes are also provided.

This project is currently under development.
