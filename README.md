# audit.me
**audit.me** is a project designed to automate the smart contract auditing process. By leveraging RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), the platform enhances the reliability and security of Solidity smart contracts. Using LLM-driven analysis, the platform retrieves relevant information from a vector database of known vulnerabilities and identifies issues in the user's code. Potential fixes are also provided, streamlining contract reviews and fostering trust in decentralized applications.
